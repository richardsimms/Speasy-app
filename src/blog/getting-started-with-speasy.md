Welcome to Speasy! If you're reading this, you're probably looking for a better way to consume your reading list. You're in the right place. Speasy transforms your saved articles into a personal podcast feed, letting you listen to your reading list instead of staring at an ever-growing backlog.

## Why Speasy exists

In today's digital world, we're constantly saving articles to "read later"—but later never comes. Your reading list grows, your inbox fills with newsletters, and before you know it, you have hundreds of unread items piling up. The guilt builds, and the pressure to catch up becomes overwhelming.

Speasy solves this problem by converting your articles into high-quality audio content. Now you can:
- **Listen while multitasking**: Catch up on articles during your commute, workout, or while doing household chores
- **Reduce screen time**: Give your eyes a break after a long day
- **Stay informed**: Never miss important content from your favorite sources
- **Enjoy learning**: Turn information consumption into a pleasant, stress-free experience

## Your first steps with Speasy

### 1. Sign up and connect your accounts

Getting started is simple. After creating your Speasy account, you can connect:
- **Browser bookmarks**: Import your saved articles from Safari, Chrome, and other browsers
- **Reading list apps**: Sync with Instapaper, Pocket, or other read-later services
