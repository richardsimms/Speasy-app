# Rule: Commit messages must follow commitlint conventions

## Description
Use commitlint-style Conventional Commits when creating, editing, or suggesting git commit messages for this repository. Enforce the same rules that the `@commitlint/config-conventional` preset expects. [web:1]

## Why this rule matters
- Commit messages are linted using commitlint and must pass its checks. [web:1]
- Conventional, structured messages improve changelog generation, release automation, and collaboration. [web:1][web:7]

## When this rule applies
- Whenever you propose a git commit message.
- Whenever you modify an existing commit message.
- Whenever you write examples of commit messages in docs, comments, or explanations.

## Required format

Always use a single-line header in the following format:

`<type>[optional scope]: <short, imperative description>`

- `<type>` is required and must be a valid conventional type.
- `<scope>` is optional and, when used, is placed in parentheses after the type, with no spaces: `type(scope): description`.
- The description must be short, in the imperative mood, and written in lowercase except for proper nouns. [web:1][web:7]

body's lines must not be longer than 150 characters [body-max-line-length]


### Allowed types

Prefer the standard set used by `@commitlint/config-conventional`: [web:1]

- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation-only changes.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect meaning of the code (formatting, whitespace, etc.).
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `perf`: A change that improves performance.
- `test`: Adding or updating tests.
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration or scripts.
- `chore`: Other changes that do not modify src or test files.
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit; message should reference the reverted commit. [web:1]

If in doubt, choose from these types and avoid inventing new ones.

### Examples of valid headers

- `feat(api): add job recommendation endpoint`
- `fix(ui): correct overflow in job list`
- `docs: update README with setup instructions`
- `chore: bump commitlint version`

### Body and footer

When a body or footer is needed, follow Conventional Commits guidelines: [web:7]

- Separate header, body, and footer with a blank line.
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how.
- Mark breaking changes clearly using `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer followed by a description, or use `!` after the type/scope in the header (for example, `feat!: ...`). [web:7]

### Line length

- Keep the header line under 72 characters when possible.
- Wrap body and footer text so lines are reasonably short and readable.

## Things to avoid

- Do not write commits without a type (for example, `update stuff` is invalid).
- Do not capitalize the type (use `feat`, not `Feat`).
- Do not end the header line with a period.
- Do not use vague descriptions like `stuff`, `changes`, or `fixes`.
- Do not include multiple unrelated changes in one commit message; prefer smaller, focused commits.

## How the agent should behave

- If a user supplies a non-conforming commit message, suggest a corrected version that passes commitlint.
- When summarizing changes, propose one or more commit messages in the required format.
- If information is missing (for example, there are unrelated changes), ask the user for clarification instead of guessing a misleading type or description.
